#how to go about testing

#1) write unit tests for analysis functions
	a) need to simulate psana data object structure... no,
	
#2) have testing pipe line that goes through script to generate acq eigen analysis.
#	a) this script will change because it's not yet stream lined
	b) need to write reconstruction script (in other test files in stream lined analysis functions)
		i)this will require comparing good SVD reconstructions with bad SVD reconstructions

#3)
